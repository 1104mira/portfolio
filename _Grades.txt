Grade: 100

Comment: You did a good job with choosing unique IDs for your CSS selectors.   You might want to consider choosing names that are more descriptive about what you are styling to help keep your code readable.

Assignment: Add an image to your About Me page and edit the CSS so the image and paragraphs are side-by-side.

Comment: Again, good job with this.  The use of widths as percentages instead of just floats was a good approach.

Assignment: Use Google Forms to add a contact form to your page.

Grade: 85

Comment:  You got this in early, good job, but the form is broken... it looks like you have the link broken up in to two lines, which caused the problem.

You had this:

src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfY5jdhOlMiwIQT 
  TX4SkU21Z9zhdlsyc0vJW_C7J01wJjeT4g/viewform?embedded=true"

and it needed to be this:

src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfY5jdhOlMiwIQTTX4SkU21Z9zhdlsyc0vJW_C7J01wJjeT4g/viewform?embedded=true"

(I know it probably wraps to multiple lines, but that's just the way it's displayed... it's all one long line.  Try clicking [Alt]+Z and see the line wrapping change.)
