        <p id="tm">My name is Amira Johnson. I like to write poetry it feeds my soul. I like to stay active by doing things like sports,
            and ect. I like to wite books not just for me but for any audeince, I feel that if writting a good book is a
            way of people feeling great then why not. I like to think of myself as a serious, but ambitious person yes, I
            know I can be to dertermine, but honestly people still describe me as funny even though I don't see that at all.</p>
        <p id="yellow">I think life is something complex and you just have to work through it, becasue even though it might be hard and
            seem rough you can work thorugh and you will, and you will feel really good afterwards. I wrote this quote myself
            it states, "Don't be a product of criticism, be the outcome of uniqueness". What this means to me is that instead
            of being what people say you are or treat you as be something you think is amazing, nobody is going to tell you
            who you are. With this type of mind set you can really do anything.</p>
